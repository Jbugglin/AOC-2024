Advent of Code 2024

Day 1 / Part 1:
    -sig locals unique number called LOCATION ID
    -2 groups or lists
    -pair up the numbers side by side, and measure their distance
    -pair up SMALLEST NUMBER in the left list with the SMALLEST NUMBER in the right list.
    -figure how far apart the 2 numbers are
    -add up all of those distances...

    -possibly sort both lists smallest # to largest, then find difference of both?

    -python to scrape and parse?

Left smallest: 10029
Right smallest: 10013
Difference: 00016


Correct Answer: 2904518 <--We got it!!!!

Day 1 / Part 2:

We need to figure out how often each number from the left list appears in the right list.

Calculate a similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.  

so...

simularity score = add up the numbers in left list after
                    multiplying it by the number of times it
                    occurs in the right...

Correct answer: 18650129 <-- Another Gold star!
